        <h2>[Research and Inspirations]</h2>
        <div class="design-text">
            <p>
                A lot of my inspirations in designing this project came from my
                current courses and likes. For instance, I enjoy learning about
                astronomy and space, and so this contributed to the idea of a 
                space themed background.
                <br>
                <br>
                My previous project, CCT260 Project 1, which can be downloaded 
                <a href="../documents/CCT260 Project 1.pdf">here</a>,
                looked into depth about a lot of websites. These inspirations
                also followed into this project, namely the positions of a site's
                logo on the top left, the main title in the center to the left 
                of a photo, and the navigation bar to the top right of the screen.
                <br>
                <br>
                A course that I'm taking this semester (as of April 2023) is
                CSC209, Systems Programming. This course goes in depth about 
                using Linux systems including Bash, C programming and 
                computer memory. In addition to being a current computer 
                science student, I designed the home page to demonstrate a 
                command terminal like display.
            </p>
            <div class="images" id="process-imgs">

                <p>
                    The command terminal. Though this image shows the command
                    prompt as deguzm97@dh2026pc03:~$, it is also common to see
                    the '>' symbol.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                I also initially visually designed this project to mimic the
                theme of my favourite novel, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint,
                which you can find 
                <a href="https://orv-epub.carrd.co/" target="_blank">here</a>.
                It contains a lot of themes regarding constellations and
                book tropes, and so a lot of designs on this site feature this,
                from the background to the website logo.

        <h2>[Sketches and Ideas]</h2>
        <div class="design-text">
            <p>
                The initial ideas from the aforementioned research process
                stage, as well as other inspirations, brought about several
                sketches for pages and logos. These sketches were done on both
                ibisPaint X, a drawing software, and the built-in iPhone Notes
                application.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="design-section">
            <h3>[Logo Creation]</h3>
            <div class="design-text">
                <p>
                    The first idea for a personal website logo was to use my
                    name initials, H and D. However, I felt that the logo was
                    too simple, and that I could design an icon that better
                    represented me and the website, and so this sketch, as
                    shown in the following image, was quickly discarded.
                </p>
                <div class="images" id="process-imgs">
                    <img src="../images/h_d_logo.jpg" alt="logo of letters H and D merged">
                    <p>
                        The first variation of the website's logo. The red 
                        shows part of the H letter within the logo, and the 
                        blue represents the letter D.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The second idea was inspired by
                    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/128q671/the_way_the_fridge_magnets_are_organized_after_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf">
                        this Reddit post
                    </a>
                    of a person organizing magnet letters. I drew a sketch of
                    the lowercase h letter organized similar to that of a
                    flower, but I did not use this design in the end. Rather, 
                    this design also resembles a star in some way, so it
                    contributed to the next sketch idea. 
                </p>
                <div class="images" id="process-imgs">
                    <img src="../images/h_star_logo.jpg" alt="logo of 4 h letters in a sequence">
                    <p>
                        The second variation of the website's logo.
                        <br>If this image was tilted at a 45 degree angle, it
                        somewhat resembles a star. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The final idea, and the logo that is used in the final
                    product, is a simple star icon. It also somewhat shows the
                    original idea of my initials being used in the logo.
                    Furthermore, this is a simple design that compliments the
                    simplicity of the rest of the site design, and so I believed
                    that this was the best choice to create in Adobe Illustrator
                    moving forward.
                </p>
                <div class="images" id="process-imgs">
                    <img src="../images/final_h_d_star_logo.jpg" alt="logo of star">
                    <p>
                        The final variation of the website's logo.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Note that other drawings were created after this final idea,
                    and are documented below, but the following sketches do not
                    hold any significance to the outcome of the final website
                    design.

        </div>
        <div class="design-section">
            <h3>[Page Creation]</h3>
            <div class="design-text">
                <p>
                    Unlike the multiple logo variation sketches, I had a somewhat
                    clear idea of what my pages would look like. I focused more
                    on the format of the home page, as this is meant to give
                    a definitive, yet small, description of the website's
                    purpose. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Taking inspiration from the previous project's research, this
                    variation shows the website logo to the left of the screen,
                    while the navigation bar is to the right. There is one main
                    container in this sketch that contains the title and any
                    underlining text.
                </p>
                <div class="images" id="process-imgs">
                    <img src="../images/initial_home_idea.jpg" alt="space background with title in left column">
                    <p>
                        The first variation of the home page.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Then, since this project is being created for a standard
                    1280px screen, a rough sketch to map out the dimensions of all
                    containers and texts was created.
                </p>
                <div class="images" id="process-imgs">
                    <img src="../images/format_home_dimensions.jpg" alt="two columns and dimensions of container widths">
                    <p>
                        Dimensions of the home page. This is also the main idea
                        that inspired the wireframe, which in turn influenced the
                        prototype, and ultimately the website itself.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>              
                    This sketch also brought about the idea of having a moving
                    background for some pages. Since the background was set to
                    be something related to astronomy and space, I decided to
                    draw a starlink, which is coined as the train of moving
                    lights in the night sky from the Tesla corporation inventions.

                        At 1:15, this animation of a train's lights in the sky
                        closely resembles a starlink, which further helped in
                        drawing and animating the background video used in the 
                        final product.

        <div class="design-text">
            <h3>[First Information Architecture Diagram]</h3>
            <p>
                Given the five page specifications, I designed this documented 
                process page to fall under the portfolio navigation link.
                <br>
                With respect to Brown's Principles of Information Architecture,
                these navigation categories adhere to the principle of growth,
                which is the practice of creating directories broad enough to
                account for any future content growth. This allows any future
                implementations to easily add content without restructuring the
                entire website navigation header. This includes any upcoming
                projects that can easily be added to the Portfolio page, as
                well as updating biographies and contact links.
                <br>
                It also complies with the principle of front doors, which
                Brown defines as the idea that at least half of the site's
                visitors will not come through the main home page. As such,
                it is important to ensure that all important pages are
                accessible at all times. This is evident in the global
                navigation header, which allows all users to navigate to their
                desired page regardless of the current page being visited.
                <br>

                <img src="../images/ia.png" alt="information architecture diagram of home, portfolio, resume, contact, process">
                <p>
                    The first four categories (Home, Portfolio, Resume, Contact)
                    are global structural navigation links, and the Project 
                    Website page is considered as a local structural category.

            <div class="design-text">
                <p>
                    I realized that adding an images page that features notable
                    photos (taken by myself) would be better than showing just
                    one photo on the portfolio page, and so the image category
                    was created. This is where my most notable photographs would
                    be displayed in as a gallery. This also allows for Brown's
                    principle of growth, as photos can easily be added to the
                    end of the galley in the future.
                    <br>
                    After deciding to add an images page, I changed the Information
                    Architecture to include the Image page. This is not a major change,
                    but crucial to understanding the final product navigation.

        <div class="design-text">
            <p>
                Taking elements from the research stage, several variations of pages
                were initialized as wireframes. All of these ideas stemmed from the
                goal of creating an astronomic like site, with elements of computer
                science and constellations.
                <br>
                <br>
                In regards to Christopher Wickens' 13 Principles of Display Design,
                the wireframe follows several principles of usability. For instance,
                all the global navigation headers are boldfaced and uppercase, which
                distinguish it from other types of text and adheres to the principle
                of making displays legible. To add, the principle of avoiding
                similarity and absolute judgement is used in the use of both text
                transformation, weight, and colour contrast.

                Initially, the logo to the top left of the final product included
                my last name. However, when implementing it in the home page, I 
                found it to be too crowded, and so I removed the text, leaving 
                only the logo, and determined this decision to be the better design.
                <br>The button under the home page that was first intended to 
                transition to the portfolio page was changed to directly link to 
                this process page. Though the initial button idea complimented the
                biography above, I thought that some users may miss the drop-down
                menu under the Portfolio navigation link, which lists said 
                process page. To avoid this, the button was changed to this design 
                in the final product.
                <br>Other than these slight changes, most features from the 
                wireframes were implemented without any further modifications.

        <h2>[Designing Website and Other References]</h2>
        <div class="design-text">
            <p>
                From the prototype, the website was implemented in accordance. This
                site naturally follows from and displays the aforementioned research
                and design processes.
                <br>It is important to note that there are several changes made to the
                final product that were not documented in the prototype. However, most
                of these modifications are impartial to the overall structure of the 
                site, and any major differences are explicitly described here. 
                <br>
                <br>In error, I initially implemented the website without accounting
                for the different containers required. Each individual text and image
                had to be padded with the same number of pixels, rather than simply 
                padding a single container that held all the texts and photos. To add,
                the site was explicitly formatted for a standard 1280x720px screen, but
                outside the scope of this project, I realized that this site should be 
                accessible regardless of screen resolution. This made the stylesheet and
                html files unorganized and long to manage, and so this was scrapped entirely.
                <br>
                <br>After starting again, I took necessary containers and position
                formatting into account. This included creating containers with borders first,
                and adjusting their margins using percentages of the user’s screen resolution 
                instead of pixels. 
            </p>

                    <p>
                        A reference to how the border element was used to format the
                        home page. Note that the image currently pictured to the right
                        belongs to @1L9l2Aa8UCL0IGJ on Twitter, and was only a
                        temporary placeholder for any picture. It remains available in
                        the source files for reference.

                To make the background, I used ibisPaint X, a drawing software, to 
                draw the space background and the moving starlink found in the home 
                page. Then, I used Adobe After Effects to create the movie, which can 
                be downloaded
                <a href="../videos/home_bg.mp4" target="_blank">here</a>.
                <br>I also created another loop video with a different gradient
                background, that can also be downloaded 
                <a href="../videos/home_bg_gradient.mp4" target="_blank">here</a>,
                but in terms of design, the first video is significantly more appealing
                to me, and so this video only remains for initial documentation.

                Many steps were taken to ensure that accessibility was available
                on this website. This includes using the WAVE Evaluation tool 
                found on the Google Chrome extension store, which shows a 17.82:1 contrast
                ratio on this site, passing the WAGC2.0 Accessibility Guidelines. For
                reference, the foreground includes all text on this site, and the
                background colour is derived from the videos and photos created.
