                This is a document of the process development of this website project.

                other sources that are cited in its respective code areas.

        <h2>[Research and Inspirations]</h2>
        <div class="design-text">
            <p>
                A lot of my inspirations in designing this project came from my
                current courses and likes. For instance, I enjoy learning about
                astronomy and space, and so this contributed to the idea of a 
                space themed background.
                <br>
                A course that I'm taking this semester (as of April 2023) is
                CSC209, Systems Programming. This course goes in depth about 
                using Linux systems including Bash, C programming and 
                computer memory. In addition to being a current computer 
                science student, I designed the home page to demonstrate a 
                command terminal like display.

                <p>The command terminal.</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                I also initially visually designed this project to mimic the
                theme of my favourite novel, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint,
                which you can find 
                <a href="https://orv-epub.carrd.co/" target="_blank">here</a>.
                It contains a lot of themes regarding constellations and
                book tropes, and so a lot of designs on this site feature this,
                from the background to the website logo.

            <h3>[First Information Architecture Diagram]</h3>
            <p>
                Given the five page specifications, I designed this documented 
                process page to fall under the portfolio navigation link.
                <br>
                With respect to Brown's Principles of Information Architecture,
                these navigation categories adhere to the principle of growth,
                which is the practice of creating directories broad enough to
                account for any future content growth. This allows any future
                implementations to easily add content without restructuring the
                entire website navigation header.

                    The first four categories (Home, Portfolio, Resume, Contact)
                    are global structural navigation links, and the Project 
                    Website page is considered as a local structural category.

                    After deciding to add an images page, I changed the Information
                    Architecture to include the Image page. This is not a major change,
                    but crucial to understanding the final product navigation.

                Taking elements from the research stage, several variations of pages
                were initialized as wireframes. All of these ideas stemmed from the
                goal of creating an astronomic like site, with elements of computer
                science and constellations.

        <h2>[Prototypes]</h2>
        <div class="design-text">
            <p>
                Initially, the logo to the top left of the final product included
                my last name. However, when implementing it in the home page, I 
                found it to be too crowded, and so I removed the text, leaving 
                only the logo, and determined this decision to be the better design.
                <br>The button under the home page that was first intended to 
                transition to the portfolio page was changed to directly link to 
                this process page. Though the initial button idea complimented the
                biography above, I thought that some users may miss the drop-down
                menu under the Portfolio navigation link, which lists said 
                process page. To avoid this, the button was changed to this design 
                in the final product.
                <br>Other than these slight changes, most features from the 
                wireframes were implemented without any further modifications.

        <h2>[Designing Website and Other References]</h2>
        <div class="design-text">
            <p>
                From the prototype, the website was implemented in accordance. This
                site naturally follows from and displays the aforementioned research
                and design processes.
                <br>It is important to note that there are several changes made to the
                final product that were not documented in the prototype. However, most
                of these modifications are impartial to the overall structure of the 
                site, and any major differences are explicitly described here. 
                <br>
                <br>In error, I initially implemented the website without accounting
                for the different containers required. Each individual text and image
                had to be padded with the same number of pixels, rather than simply 
                padding a single container that held all the texts and photos. To add,
                the site was explicitly formatted for a standard 1280x720px screen, but
                outside the scope of this project, I realized that this site should be 
                accessible regardless of screen resolution. This made the stylesheet and
                html files unorganized and long to manage, and so this was scrapped entirely.
                <br>
                <br>After starting again, I took necessary containers and position
                formatting into account. This included creating containers with borders first,
                and adjusting their margins using percentages of the user’s screen resolution 
                instead of pixels. 
                <br>
                <br>To make the background, I used ibisPaint X to draw the space
                background and the moving starlink found in the home page. Then, I
                used Adobe After Effects to create the movie, which can be downloaded
                <a href="../videos/home_bg.mp4" target="_blank">here</a>.
                <br>I also created another loop video with a different gradient
                background, found 
                <a href="../videos/home_bg_gradient.mp4" target="_blank">here</a>,
                but I scrapped the video since it didn't follow my initial design plan of
                a dark background and white text.

                Many steps were taken to ensure that accessibility was available
                on this website. This includes using the WAVE Evaluation tool 
                found on the Google Chrome extension store, which shows a 8.54 contrast
                on this site, passing the WAGC2.0 Accessibility Guidelines.
